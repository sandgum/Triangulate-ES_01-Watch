# Triangulate ES_01 E-ink Watch
---
An ultra-thin ESP32S3-based smartwatch (at just 5mm thick at its thickest point) which uses an E-ink display and two OLEDs to display information while consuming very little power. The main E-ink panel is touch-enabled, with the two additional OLED panels above and below it displaying auxiliary information, such as notifications, background activities etc. 
The watch has built-in heart rate and spO2 sensing via an Analog Devices MAX30102, high-precision smart movement sensing via a Bosch BH260AP IMU and a Bosch BMP585 barometric pressure sensor.

To top it all off, the ES_01 is completely workout-friendly, with rubberised sides and no pesky side buttons that get pressed mid-pushup (Every physical input is at the top of the watch)!
The watch features a sleek design, with each component being laid out single file and in its own separate segment of the watch. These segments can all bend around the watch, preserving a uniform thickness all around, which also adds the benefit of being aesthetically pleasing.
The main microcontroller running the watch is an Espressif ESP32-S3 running with Bluetooth capabilities, which also allow for it to sync with a smartphone to relay notifications, workout data etc through firmware based on ESP-IDF. (Coming soon!)
